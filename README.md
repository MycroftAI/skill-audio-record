Record audio and play it back

## About 
This Skill records audio from the microphone that is set for Mycroft, and allows you to play back the recorded audio. This Skill is particularly useful when trying to diagnose microphone and recording issues, because it allows you to "hear" what Mycroft is hearing. 

## Examples 
* "Record"
* "Play"
* "Stop"
* "Cancel"
